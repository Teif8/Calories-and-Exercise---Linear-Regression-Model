# Calories-and-Exercise-Linear-Regression-Model

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that uses a machine learning model to predict calories burned based on exercise data. The model is built using **Linear Regression** from the `scikit-learn` library.

## Features
- Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and feature scaling.
- Training a **Linear Regression** model to predict calorie burn based on exercise features.
- Evaluation of the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).
- Visualization of the predicted vs actual calories burned to assess model accuracy.

## Machine Learning Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Data cleaning (removing or imputing missing values).
   - Feature selection and scaling (if necessary).
   
2. **Model Training**:
   - Linear Regression model using `scikit-learn`.
   - Model fitting to training data.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluation using metrics like MSE and R² to assess the accuracy.
   - Visualization of the results using plots (e.g., predicted vs actual).

## Requirements
To run the notebook, you will need the following Python packages:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these packages by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
